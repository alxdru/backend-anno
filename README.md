# backend-anno
REST API for managing annotations, conflicts, statistics and tasks models for app-anno.

It is only one single backend service due to fast prototyping. For scaling reasons, it should be converted into four different micro-services for each model.

Check out the app-anno repository for more info on the app flow.
